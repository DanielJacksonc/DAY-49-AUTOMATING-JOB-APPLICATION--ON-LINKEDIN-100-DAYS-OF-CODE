Project Objective
The goal of today's project is to learn to use Selenium to automate
applying for jobs. Thus, by the end of today, you should have a program
 that can use LinkedIn's "Easy Apply" function to send applications to
  all the jobs that meet your criteria (instead of just a single listing).

If you have any reservations about sending job applications to the job
 listings on LinkedIn, an alternative is to "Save" all the jobs that meet
  your criteria and follow the company that posted the job instead.
